This python script checks a website for its links for their response codes. 
Links that are js are ignored ,for now. I'm still learning, so not sure its needed. 

## for Jupyter notebooks
This file was made on a Jupyter notebook, but you are free to cutnpaste where ever you like to run it. 

## Goals
-- refine to a .py file that can run from terminal
-- create a chrome extension to be used in conjunction with other accessibility checking tools, such as WAVE.
